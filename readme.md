**H37** is a specialized Discord bot designed to help the **Once Human** game community track and manage in-game reset events. The bot is capable of automating the display of upcoming loot resets, phase resets, and vendor/commission resets, along with dynamic game events like **Hal's Moving House**. It interacts with users via slash commands and automatically updates a designated channel with the latest information.
